# resume-site

The website code is unlicensed, the images are GPL (credit goes to Teresa Dreibelbis). If you mess up it's whatever but that's what makes the most sense imo.
Actual resume text was replaced with lorem ipsum before publishing to prevent identity theft or forgery or whatever, please don't go digging around.
