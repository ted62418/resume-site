            warehouse worker from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Hopefully this will change soon, I'm currently learning web development and Netherlandic. I dream of living in Europe and living every day like a tourist. I enjoy listening to music (especially Eurovision), creating textile art, learning random things, and playing the occasional video game. </p>

            <h2>Academics</h2>
            <h3>High School:</h3>
                <p>I skipped 8th grade, attended cyber school, Grier School, and Cumberland Valley High School among others. I graduated from CVHS with a 3.5 GPA and above-average SAT score.</p>
            <h3>College:</h3>
                <p>I worked almost full-time until I was 20 and realized that I could go to college for free with state funding. I was overly motivated, took 18 credits online, and ended up taking a full time job during the pandemic. Needless to say I got burnout and dropped out after getting 30+ general education and technology credits and a 3.6 GPA. </p>
            <h3>Post-College:</h3>
                <p>I finally recovered from the burnout! Taking a spontaneous trip to Iowa last year woke me up to the fact that I have a life to live, so I began learning web development and Dutch with plans to go to Europe later in 2023.</p>
